# scanner


This script performs a quick automated nmap scan for a single domain. I use this for hackthebox challenges.
It focuses on flexibility and customization as it is not faster than nmap itself. Future implementations will come along.
The goal is to create a good enumeration tool for hackthebox challenges.
