# scanner


This script can perform an automated nmap scan for single domains, find other subdomains&vhosts or fuzz directorys. I use this for hackthebox challenges. 
It focuses on flexibility and customization. Future implementations will come along. 
The goal is to create a good enumeration tool for hackthebox challenges.
